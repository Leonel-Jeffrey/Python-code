Task: Check if a number is even and less than 50
Solution: the if and else statement is used to figure out this
num = int(input("Enter an integer number: "))
if num % 2 == 0 and num < 50:
    print("Number entered is an even number and is < 50")
else:
    print("Number entered is an odd number or is < 50")

if num % 2 == 0 and num > 20:
    print("x is an even number and is > 20")
else:
    if num > 20:
        print("x is > 20.")
    else:
        print("x is an odd number.")
